# System Design

This document has been created to guide the building of the `linguify` system, and the components that make this system up. As a design philosophy, the linguify system is modular (independent), but capable of being orchestrated and developed on to produce core functions like messaging to even more sophisticated task like natural language processing. 

## System Synopsis

The `linguify` system is a platform for language learning where people create `profiles` and engage with other users in conversation and `language games`. The system is designed to match language learners based on their language proficiencies and interest. Once the language learners have been matched, then they can engage in a *short video chat and ice breaking `language games`. After this initial encounter, the users rate each other on the interaction and can choose to schedule another meeting (i.e., reunion, appointment) or continue browsing for other `language partners`. 

## System Components

Practically, the `linguify` system is a language learning service that also functions as a messaging application:

- `Profiles`
    - "My Account"
    - "Settings"
    - 
- `Users`
    - Community
- `Games`
    - Language
- `Messenger`
    - ?
    - Video Chat
- `Dashboard`
    - Learning progress
        - Stats
    - Library
        - Blogs for language X
        - Books for language X
        - Art for language X
- `Lobby`
    - Rooms
        - Public
        - Private

## System Specification (Admin)

The linguify system is expected to run on both mobile and desktop devices. That is, there will need to be a linguify application that targets (and downloaded) mobile and desktop systems. Such cross-platform targeting can be achieved through cross-platform frameworks like `Xamarin`, `Ionic`, or `React/React Native`. Thus, the computational nature of the `linguify` system is most likely to be specified (expressed) in `JavaScript` or `C#`.
